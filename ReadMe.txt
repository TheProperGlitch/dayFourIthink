Files:
    Car: The Car class
    Fleet: The Fleet class
    Main: The assignment for homework (a file that makes 16 random cars w/ miles 1-100, puts them
    into a fleet, and returns the car with the most miles.)
    Sub: A file I used to test the methods.
Methods:
    p(): A method I made that prints out what it is given. Essentially a shorthand for 
    System.out.println with variation for different data types.
